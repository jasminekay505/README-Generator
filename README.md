# README-Generator
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)  

This application uses command-line prompts to create a high-quality README.md file to be used when creating an open source project on GitHub. The generated README.md file takes in user input from the command-line with the Inquirer package and puts out a file based on the user input.   

The user inputs the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license information, GitHub username and email address.   

The application creates a README.md file titled: *project name*-README.md with the project title as the title, a working Table of Contents, a license badge, and filled out sections for description, installation, usage, contribution and test instructions based on user input.
